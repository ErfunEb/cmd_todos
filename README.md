# Command Line Todo App

This is a CMD todo app for managing your todos, written in Rust language and `sqlite` crate.

## How to run

**Note:** You need to have rust and cargo installed in your terminal or command line.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ErfunEb/cmd_todos.git
```

After cloning the repo, go to the `cmd_todos` directory:

```sh
cd cmd_todos
```

At the end, run the following command for build and run:

```sh
